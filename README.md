# Shelter Animal Adoption Project
This project is aim to find what is the reason cause an animal leave the shelter. Also, making people know more about the animal shelter and encourage them to do the animal adoption and save these animals' life.

In project, I builds a full machine learning pipeline to predict animal adoption outcomes using the Austin Animal Center dataset which can be found in data folder. After extensive preprocessing, including categorical normalization, missing-value handling, one-hot encoding, and numerical scaling, I trained and evaluated several models, with XGBoost achieving the strongest overall performance.

You can access the entire code from Project.ipynb Jupyter Notebook in src folder and all the summary plots in figures folder.
